# AnimatedArt

This was meant to be one thing, however I got sidetracked again, as usual. Here I discover the WriteableBitmap and the use of the CompositionTarget.Rendering concept.

If you run this code, you'll need the extensions to WriteableBitMap from : https://github.com/teichgraf/WriteableBitmapEx/

Pretty easy to use DLL written in C# by teichgraf (http://kodierer.blogspot.co.uk/) - thank you!

I'll probably add new variations, so you'll have to check through the history to see where I started.
